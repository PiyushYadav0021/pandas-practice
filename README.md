# Pandas Practice – From Basics to Real-World Applications

This repository is my complete hands-on journey through the **Pandas** library in Python — starting from basic concepts like Series and DataFrames, all the way to advanced data manipulation, cleaning, merging, and working with real-world datasets.

---

## ✅ What’s Covered

### 📘 Core Concepts (with Examples)
- Creating and working with **Series**
- Creating and manipulating **DataFrames**
- Handling **missing/null data**
- **Indexing**, **slicing**, and selecting data
- **Merging**, **joining**, and **concatenating** datasets
- Working with **groupby**, **pivot tables**, and **multi-indexing**
- **Sorting**, **filtering**, and applying functions
- Exporting data to and from CSV, Excel, etc.

### 📊 Real-World Practice
- **2 real-world datasets** (will be added soon)
- Practical use cases: data cleaning, EDA, and analysis
- Visual summaries with Matplotlib/Seaborn (optional for later)
